MoJS
====

MoJS is not a framework per s√© but only a name for a collection of libraries that are each optional and work without the others. 

These are:

MoVC - Model View Controller

MoCP - Mo Client Pages

MoEV - Mo Events

MoVC_MoCP_Integration - A plugin that makes MoVC and MoCP play nice together.
